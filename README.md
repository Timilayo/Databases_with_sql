Database Querying using SQLite
This project involves connecting the SQLite database with Python. In this project, I used Google Collab.
Step 1: Create a database in SQLite, upload the tables to the database (in this case, the tables were stored in a CSV file), and then save (ensure to save this database)
Step 2: Upload the database file in Google Collab
Step 3: Google Collab already has the necessary libraries installed, so proceed to link the database with the work environment, then you can query the database to extract the essential data needed (check the readme file for more details)
